## Project: “Characterizing antibody-antigen interaction interfaces”
- Apply PRODIGY / Binding Affinity Prediction Repository and Biopython to mine interaction descriptors.
- Expand interaction network used for Machine Learning prediction models.

## What is PRODIGY / Binding Affinity Prediction Repository?

Understanding the structural characteristics of protein-protein interactions is crucial for developing therapies and for understanding biological processes and disorders. Accurately predicting the binding strength for a certain protein-protein complex is a crucial component of this. In this project, we used PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY)  a web service that determines the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes based on their three-dimensional (3D) structure. Our straightforward yet incredibly accurate prediction model, based on intermolecular interactions and characteristics extracted from non-interface surfaces, is implemented by the PRODIGY server.
